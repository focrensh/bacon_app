F5 Beacon Overview
==================

In this section we will go over the different sections within the Beacon portal. You will notice many of the objects created during the `lab setup` portion of this lab.

.. NOTE:: If you have existing applications or configuered objects with Beacon, your portal may appear slightly different than this guides examples.


Navigate to the |Portal| and login using your F5 Cloud Services account. This link will take you directly to the Beacon service within the portal.
